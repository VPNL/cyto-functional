Notes on how to register ROIs from the MRI of post-mortem to their 3D histological reconstuctions



AFNI Steps
Step 0
source /etc/afni/afni.sh

Step 1.

The purpose of this step is to roughly align the two brains volumes using an affine tranform.

Use 3dAllineate to do a linear (12DoF) registration from the mri volume anatomy of a subject to the 3D histological reconstuction of the same subject. 
This step creates fewer distortions for the Qwarp. 
This registration creates an output transform file called .param.1D used to roughly aline the brain volumes. It also creates the transformed volume which we are calling for now
afni_result.nii.gz

code: 
3dAllineate -prefix afni_result.nii.gz -base pm14686histo_invNlin_corr_small_histcorr_pad.nii.gz -input pm14686histo_invNlin_corr_small_histcorr_pad_lin2colin27.nii.gz -cmass -twopass -1Dparam_save afni_param

Step 2.
Applying the .param.1D registration file to the ROI to register it to the same volume.

3dAllineate -prefix niftiROIs/rh_MPM_PPA_afni.nii.gz -base pm14686histo_invNlin_corr_small_histcorr_pad.nii.gz -input niftiROIs/rh.MPM_PPA_regFrom_fsaverage-bkup.nii.gz -1Dparam_apply afni_param.param.1D

Step 3.
The purpose of this step is to use a nonlinear tranformation to align the cortical folding across the two brains. We need this step because the histological 3D reconstructed volume is distorted relative to the 3D MRI volume. 

Running the non-linear alignment between the output of 3dAllineate and the 3D histological volume reconstruction using the afni function 3dQwarp. 

This alignment generates an output volume which we called afni_result_qwarp.nii.gz  and a registration file called afni_result_qwarp_WARP.nii.gz.

3dQwarp -prefix afni_result_qwarp.nii.gz  -source afni_result.nii.gz -base pm14686histo_invNlin_corr_small_histcorr_pad.nii.gz 

Step 4. 
Apply the non-linear transform calculated in step 3 to the ROIs.
3dNwarpApply -nwarp afni_result_qwarp_WARP.nii.gz -source niftiROIs/rh_MPM_pFus_afni.nii.gz -prefix rh_MPM_pFus_anfi_3dQwarp.nii.gz
